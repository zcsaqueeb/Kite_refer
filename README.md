## **Important Notes**
1. **Points Update Delay**: Points may take up to 24 hours to reflect. The development team is addressing this issue, so please be patient.

     - Perform at least three agent actions.
     - Follow KiteAI on X (Twitter).
     - Retweet KiteAI on X (Twitter).
   - To run the autoref function, use:

     ```
     Private keys are stored in `privateKeys_ref.txt`.
